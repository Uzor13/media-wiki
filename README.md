### Thought Process
- I wanted an app that was simple to use, not crowded and with a nice user experience.
- Using citation hunt as an inspiration, I designed a basic view of the home page whilst adding a bit of color to keep the user's attention on the page.
- Added a search box to help users who already have a tool in mind to easily find the tool.
- Added a logo for personalisation and two button of different colors, one to edit the tool and the other to skip the current tool if not interested.
- Added an edit number count for the user to keep track of the number of edits done and also spark interest in using it as an inspiration in entering the leaderboard.
- Made the leaderboard page a bit playful to spark friendly competition and keeping it free by making the leaderboard a top ten of the day.
- I used information from the backend challenge to have an idea of how to present the data for the dashboard, using charts to add visuals and also having it in the number format.
- The colors chosen were non-flashy colors to avoid distraction.
